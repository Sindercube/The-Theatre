# ðŸŽ­ About ðŸŽ­

**The Theatre** is a **Fabric Modpack** centered around the **Manic & Sanguine** Data Packs.

This pack serves as a clean slate for anyone who wants to play with both Manic & Sanguine without the hassle of manually merging them, but it can also be enjoyed as-is.

**[!] Warning [!]** This project is early in development, here be dragons! Some features might not work, some might be bugged, so if you run into any issues, please report them to us!

**[!] Warning [!]** Manic & Sanguine do not officially support 1.19.2, so this pack does some hacky things to make them work.

# ðŸ©¸ Features ðŸ©¸

- Don't go insane! *Or do, i'm not your dad.*
- Do rituals for ancient horrors!
- Fight scary monsters!
- Survive Blood Moons!
- *The fog is coming.*
