# ðŸŽ­ About ðŸŽ­

**The Theatre** is a **Fabric Modpack** centered around the **Manic & Sanguine** Data Packs.

This pack serves as a clean slate for anyone who wants to play with both Manic & Sanguine without the hassle of manually merging them, but it can also be enjoyed as-is.

> For any questions related to Manic & Sanguine, go to [The Insomniacs Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jsbRvexYqA).

**[!] Warning [!]** Manic & Sanguine do not officially support 1.19.2, so this pack does some hacky things to make them work.

> For any questions related to the 1.19.2 port of Manic & Sanguine, or the Modpack itself, go to [The Sindercube Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dmKMAMf).
