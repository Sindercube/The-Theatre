# 🎭 About 🎭

**The Theatre** is a **Minecraft Modpack** centered around the **Manic & Sanguine** datapacks. It features tweaks to make the packs work together, as well as quality of life changes which can't be implemented using datapacks, like new creative tabs or custom crafting recipes (Fabric only).

This pack serves as a clean slate for anyone who wants to play with both Manic & Sanguine without the hassle of manually merging them, but it can also be enjoyed as-is.

# 🛠️ Standalone Usage 🛠️

> **[!] Warning [!]** The 1.19.2 version of Manic & Sanguine will stop being supported once the next releases of both packs come out, which will make this tutorial obsolete.

Manic & Sanguine do not officially support Minecraft 1.19.2, and as such this modpack applies tweaks which fix this incompatibility.

You can make Manic & Sanguine compatible with Minecraft 1.19.2 by simply adding this modpack's [override resourcepack](overrides/Override%20Resourcepack.zip) and [datapack](overrides/Override%20Datapack.zip) to your own instance.
